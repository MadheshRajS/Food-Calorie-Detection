## Food Calorie Detection

★ To calculate the calorie intake of food in day-to-day life.

★ To estimate food weight and calories of food.

★ To minimize the error of calories estimation.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Obesity has become a widespread phenomenon all over the    world. The obesity is based on the body mass index (BMI) of an individual. A person is considered obese when the BMI is higher than or equal to 30(kg/m2 ). In order to lose weight for obese individuals in a healthy way, as well as to maintain the a healthy weight for normal people the daily food intake must be measured, thus obesity treatment requires the patient to record the amount of the daily food intake.






## Language 

 Python

## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed go to Python website and install it. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

```bash
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install numpy
  
```

## Conclusion
The proposed work will only requires web-camera to capture I/P image. This would lead to a new generation of human computer interaction in which no physical contact with device is needed. Anyone can use the system to operate the computer easily, In this software, we detected and estimate calorie of food by showing the food in front of camera by CNN. In this experiment, we created the fruit photo dataset. In addition, we applied this food detector to food calorie estimation to determine the calorie of single fruit. we also create a dataset of calorie annotated fruit images.

## Future Enhancement
The back end of the detection and classification model part of the project. 
Next, aim is to finish the front end by creating a web application by uploading a food image and calorie estimation from the image
Also tries to detect the food object and estimates the calorie from the object shown in front of camera.
